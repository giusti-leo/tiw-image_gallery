## Information Technologies for the Web 

### Image Gallery

Image Gallery is a simple collection of images grouped in albums. The user is able to select one album and to browse through the list of images in order to see a full-size version and a description and, if desired, leave a comment.

The objective of this project was to build a Rich Internet Application using Java servlets server-side and exploting JavaScript and AJAX requests on client-side. The system is based on a simple MySQL database that stores the path in which retrieve the images in the web server. UX was not part of the course.

Final project of the Information Technologies for the Web course at Politecnico di Milano.
